Colorfy â€“ Handling colors the right way

The entrypoint for any user, who wants to exploit the functionality of
colorfy from within Python, should do the following:

  >>> import colorfy
  >>> ws = colorfy.Workspace('colors.json')

  >>> # access the imported colors as a list
  >>> cols = ws.colors

  >>> # access the imported colormaps as a list
  >>> maps = ws.colorMaps

  >>> # print the first colors definition for TeX in rgb255
  >>> cols[0].out('TeX', 'rgb255')

  >>> # print the first colorbar definition for TeX in rgb
  >>> maps[0].out('TeX', 'rgb')

For further information see the documentation of colorfy.ColorObject,
colorfy.Color, colorfy.ColorMap and colorfy.Workspace.
